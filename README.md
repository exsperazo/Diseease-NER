Ontology boosted Automatic Extraction of Disease names from Twitter
This repository contains datasets employed by Magumba et al in this paper:

M. A. Magumba, P. Nabende, and E. Mwebaze, “Ontology driven machinelearning ap-proach for disease name extraction from twitter messages,” in 2017  2nd  IEEE  International  Conference  on  Computational  Intelligenceand Applications (ICCIA), Sept 2017, pp. 68–73.

To use them for disease named entity recognition with the model provided all you need is to run the keras model on the CNF column of the datasets.
In python you can load the model using the keras load_model function
